### Python SQLite3

This repo will containt many ways of managing and manintaining sql databases.

## 1 File databases

Databases like these are small scale. mainly saved on one `.db` file

Their mostly used in small storage systems, like links, locations, number, etc....

They mostly use more then 2 `tables` to save data

## Multi-File databases, self-managed

Databases like these are used in large scale applications, but mainly use pre-built `.db` files

Not files created by the code.

These databases are used in many applications, ranging from login system to shopping systems. to save products. stuff like that

Mostly contain 1-2 `tables` per file

## Multi-File databases, self creation

Database like these are used in large scale applications like discord servers. to save different data for each server but still using 1 client

Databases like these still relay on `.db` files. But the owner doens't create them the code generates them

These databases are hard to manage but are fail-proof

Contain 2-3 `tables` on each file, serving their own purpose, If its level system or password managment.
